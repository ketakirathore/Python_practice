Data types
1. Dynamically typed language : python     *statistically typed language
ex. a=10 no need to mention that data typeswhere you mention the value
int string float boolean complex   data types of python
set list tuple dictionary


integer  ex. a = 10, the value of a 
# print(type(a)) to check the type ofdata 'int'

string = "1" , '2'
single quote or double quote value called string datatype 'str'

float - decimal type ex 12.3
'float'

boolean = true and false "bool"

complex = a+bj  j= #print(a.img) #printt(a.real)
value stored in this system called complex.

set = collection of numbers, store multiple value in single variable
ex. s = {12}
it always store in curly bracket, always need to have a value, it doesnt count repeted numbers, it change the sequence of numbers

list =a = [any type of value can be store ex 1,2,4 23.4, "python"]
to check the length of value stoed in bracket # print(len(l))= 3: count of values

tuple = t=(12,)
# print(type(t)) = 'tuple'  you have to add "," always to get tuple value

dictionary 
d={ "key":"value", "name": "john"}
type(d)= 'dict'
the format of value store in dictionary is in "key": "value" it is collection of pairs
